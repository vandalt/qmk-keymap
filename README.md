# My QMK keymap

Built as an [external userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/newbs_external_userspace).

## Keyboards

I have configs for the ZSA Moonlander and ZSA Voyager.
Both were originally built with Oryx and edited so they would compile with the latest QMK.

I am aiming to put most of the configuration in a [userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/feature_userspace) so that it is shared between the two keyboards.

Merging config files is fairly simple.
Merging the keymaps requires a bit more work. See <https://github.com/drashna/qmk_userspace/tree/master> and <https://github.com/getreuer/qmk-keymap>.
